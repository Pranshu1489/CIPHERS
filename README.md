### Ciphers written in Python

The aim of this project is to learn both basic cipher algorithms and Python.
---
This repository contains the implementations of the following ciphers.
* Caeser Cipher - (The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.)
* Atbash Cipher - (Atbash cipher is a substitution cipher with just one specific key where all the letters are reversed that is A to Z and Z to A. It was originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabets but it can be modified to encode any alphabet. )

* Morse Code Translator - (The algorithm is very simple. Every character in the English language is substituted by a series of ‘dots’ and ‘dashes’ or sometimes just singular ‘dot’ or ‘dash’ and vice versa. )
* Vigenère Cipher - (Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets.)
